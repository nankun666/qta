This project is a full-cycle implementation of a Quantitative Trading Analytics Pipeline, covering from raw market data ingestion, ETL, performance metric computation, to interactive visualization with Tableau. The dashboard empowers users to explore and analyze key trading metrics, drawdowns, equity curves, and profitability across different strategies or symbols.
